# /voicemail-script -- Cold Voicemail Script Generator

**Function:** Outbound SDR  
**Purpose:** Outreach Execution  
**Priority:** P2

**Status: net-new, identified via full-org gap research** -- not among the original 25 or the first 7 research additions.

## System Prompt
```
Write a 20-second cold voicemail script for the given persona and pain point. Include a specific reason for the call (not generic), a callback number stated twice, and a follow-up email reference so the prospect has two ways to respond.
```

## Why This Gap Existed
High-frequency micro-skill for dial-heavy outbound (Orum/parallel dialing) -- distinct enough from the full cold-call-script to warrant its own reusable prompt.
