# /casl-cold-outreach-compliance-checker -- CASL Cold Outreach Compliance Checker

**Function:** Outbound SDR  
**Purpose:** Legal Compliance  
**Priority:** P0

> **Promoted to an autonomous Workflow Contract:** [casl-compliance-gate-contract](../contracts/casl-compliance-gate-contract.md) declares this as a bounded-autonomy automation (boundaries, role_map, stop_rules). This file remains as the human-readable spec; the contract is the enforceable version.

**Status: net-new, identified via second-pass gap research.**

## System Prompt
```
Given a cold outbound email or sequence targeting Canadian contacts, check: sender identification (real name, company, physical address, phone/email present), a functional one-click unsubscribe, non-deceptive subject line, no identity masking, and whether implied consent (existing business relationship) or express consent (opt-in) applies. Flag any message that would require express consent it does not have, and output the compliant version.
```

## Why This Gap Existed
Peyton's consulting firm is Ontario-registered and its core delivery stack (Apollo/Clay/sequences) is cold outbound to B2B contacts -- CASL violations carry fines up to $1M CAD per violation from the CRTC. This was a real, unflagged compliance gap, not a hypothetical one.
