bounded_autonomy_note: invoked within a human-invoked parent agent's single turn; if any calling parent is later promoted to an autonomous gtm-os/contracts/ Workflow Contract, this sub-agent's role belongs in that contract's role_map (see pipeline-risk-contract.yaml's data_audit_agent/synthesis_agent split for the existing precedent)

# Sub-Agent: Competitive Intel Lookup

**Slug:** `competitive-intel-lookup`

## Task (single-purpose, reusable)
Given a named competitor, retrieve and synthesize the relevant profile from wiki/competitive/ (tool profile, friction/objection heatmap data) into a 3-bullet strengths/weaknesses summary for the specific deal context.

## Called By (parent agents that invoke this sub-agent)
[account-brief-generator](../account-brief-generator.md) . [competitive-battlecard](../competitive-battlecard.md) . [rfp-proposal-generator](../rfp-proposal-generator.md) . [positioning-framework](../positioning-framework.md) . [prospect-stack-gap-finder](../prospect-stack-gap-finder.md)

## Why This Exists As a Sub-Agent, Not Duplicated Logic
5 different top-level agents need this exact primitive. Rather than each parent re-deriving the logic, they invoke this shared sub-agent and consume its output -- one place to fix or improve the logic instead of 5.
