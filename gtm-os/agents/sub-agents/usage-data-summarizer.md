bounded_autonomy_note: invoked within a human-invoked parent agent's single turn; if any calling parent is later promoted to an autonomous gtm-os/contracts/ Workflow Contract, this sub-agent's role belongs in that contract's role_map (see pipeline-risk-contract.yaml's data_audit_agent/synthesis_agent split for the existing precedent)

# Sub-Agent: Usage Data Summarizer

**Slug:** `usage-data-summarizer`

## Task (single-purpose, reusable)
Condense raw product usage/telemetry data into a health-relevant summary: trend direction, adoption breadth across the buying committee, and any anomaly worth flagging.

## Called By (parent agents that invoke this sub-agent)
[account-brief-generator](../account-brief-generator.md) . [qbr-builder](../qbr-builder.md) . [expansion-upsell-play-builder](../expansion-upsell-play-builder.md) . [renewal-playbook](../renewal-playbook.md) . [escalation-runbook](../escalation-runbook.md)

## Why This Exists As a Sub-Agent, Not Duplicated Logic
5 different top-level agents need this exact primitive. Rather than each parent re-deriving the logic, they invoke this shared sub-agent and consume its output -- one place to fix or improve the logic instead of 5.
