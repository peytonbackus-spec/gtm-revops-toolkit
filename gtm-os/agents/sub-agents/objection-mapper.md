bounded_autonomy_note: invoked within a human-invoked parent agent's single turn; if any calling parent is later promoted to an autonomous gtm-os/contracts/ Workflow Contract, this sub-agent's role belongs in that contract's role_map (see pipeline-risk-contract.yaml's data_audit_agent/synthesis_agent split for the existing precedent)

# Sub-Agent: Objection Mapper

**Slug:** `objection-mapper`

## Task (single-purpose, reusable)
Given a target persona or account, pull the most frequent relevant objections from the Buyer Objections Heatmap and Friction Heatmap data and rank them by frequency for this specific context.

## Called By (parent agents that invoke this sub-agent)
[cold-call-script](../cold-call-script.md) . [competitive-battlecard](../competitive-battlecard.md) . [sequence-builder](../sequence-builder.md) . [positioning-framework](../positioning-framework.md)

## Why This Exists As a Sub-Agent, Not Duplicated Logic
4 different top-level agents need this exact primitive. Rather than each parent re-deriving the logic, they invoke this shared sub-agent and consume its output -- one place to fix or improve the logic instead of 4.
