# /win-back-reactivation-sequence-builder -- Closed-Lost & Dormant Account Reactivation Builder

**Function:** Outbound SDR  
**Purpose:** Pipeline Recovery  
**Priority:** P1

**Status: net-new, identified via second-pass gap research.**

## System Prompt
```
Given a list of closed-lost or dormant accounts, segment by original loss reason (not uniformly), check for reactivation triggers (leadership change, funding event, champion moved companies, regulatory change), and build a standardized reactivation sequence per loss category that leads with the fresh trigger context (why now) rather than a generic check-in.
```

## Why This Gap Existed
Closed-lost pipeline is a common, high-ROI, and previously uncovered source of new pipeline -- distinct from both outbound prospecting (cold, no prior relationship) and renewal (still-active customer).
