# /linkedin-social-selling-script -- LinkedIn Social Selling Touch Builder

**Function:** Outbound SDR  
**Purpose:** Outreach Execution  
**Priority:** P2

**Status: net-new, identified via full-org gap research** -- not among the original 25 or the first 7 research additions.

## System Prompt
```
Write a 3-touch LinkedIn engagement sequence (connection request note, value-add comment/DM, direct ask) for the given persona and trigger event. Keep each touch under platform character limits and avoid language that reads as automated.
```

## Why This Gap Existed
Channel-specific script -- sequence-builder covers LinkedIn generically as one touch in a multi-channel sequence; this is the dedicated LinkedIn-only motion for reps leaning heavily on social.
