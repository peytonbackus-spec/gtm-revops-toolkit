# Repo map

Audit date: 2026-10-08. `~/gtm-revops-toolkit` is the canonical toolkit.

**Why canonical:** newest history (last commit 2026-10-07), config-driven template with no hardcoded company values, the broadest module layout (`gtm_engineer/`, `gtm_strategy_ops/`, `shared_core/`) and a tested `make new COMPANY=...` flow. `~/dev/gtm-revops-toolkit` is older (2026-09-28), has a different layout (`gtm-os/`, `wiki/`) and is richer only in prompt/agent docs and wiki content, so it is mined for files rather than promoted.

| repo | role | last commit | files worth porting (names only) |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~/gtm-revops-toolkit | canonical | 2026-10-07 | n/a |
| ~/dev/gtm-revops-toolkit | archive (source of ports) | 2026-09-28 | gtm-os/agents/* (67 prompt files), gtm-os/code/scoring/churn_prediction_pipeline.py, gtm-os/code/scoring/meddpicc_health_engine.py, gtm-os/code/sfdc_pql_ingestor.py, gtm-os/code/revops_tech_debt_tracker.py, core/engine/l2a_matcher.py, core/engine/rules_engine.py, scripts/outbound_engine.py, gtm-os/mcp/speed-to-lead/speed_to_lead_server.py. Already ported to canonical: gtm-os/contracts/*, gtm-os/schemas/*, modules/gtm_engineering/*.md (now under docs/) |
| company-specific toolkit A | company-specific | 2026-10-07 | none; derived from canonical, 54 files diverge |
| company-specific toolkit B | company-specific | 2026-10-07 | none; derived from canonical, 73 files diverge |
| company-specific toolkit C | company-specific; older lineage | 2026-09-02 | none; same structure as legacy/dev, scripts/gtm_reporting_agent.py only differs by model env var |
| company-specific toolkit D | company-specific | 2026-09-14 | ROI calculator script and menu script |
| ~/_legacy-gtm-2nd-brain-2026-08 | legacy | 2026-08-31 | none; build_gtm_system.py, scripts/sync_vault.sh only if the vault sync is revived |

Code files listed as "worth porting" were not copied: they depend on `core/models` or on dev's layout and need adapting to canonical's modules first.
