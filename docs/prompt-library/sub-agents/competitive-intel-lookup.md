# Sub-Agent: Competitive Intel Lookup

**Slug:** `competitive-intel-lookup`

## Task (single-purpose, reusable)
Given a named competitor, retrieve and synthesize the relevant profile from [tool evaluation](../../tool-evaluation/README.md) (tool profile, friction/objection heatmap data) into a 3-bullet strengths/weaknesses summary for the specific deal context.

## Called By (parent agents that invoke this sub-agent)
account-brief-generator . [competitive-battlecard](../agents/competitive-battlecard.md) . rfp-proposal-generator . positioning-framework . [prospect-stack-gap-finder](../agents/prospect-stack-gap-finder.md)

## Why This Exists As a Sub-Agent, Not Duplicated Logic
5 different top-level agents need this exact primitive. Rather than each parent re-deriving the logic, they invoke this shared sub-agent and consume its output -- one place to fix or improve the logic instead of 5.
