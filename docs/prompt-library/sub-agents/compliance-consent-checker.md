# Sub-Agent: Compliance/Consent Checker

**Slug:** `compliance-consent-checker`

## Task (single-purpose, reusable)
Given a target contact for outreach, determine the CASL consent basis and block the send if none is documented:
1. **Express consent:** an opt-in record with timestamp and source (form ID or IP).
2. **Implied consent, existing business relationship:** a purchase, contract or inquiry inside the CASL time windows, documented in the CRM.
3. **Implied consent, conspicuous publication:** the address is published (e.g. company website), with **no** statement that the person doesn't want unsolicited commercial messages, **and** the message is relevant to the person's business role or duties. Record where it was published and when it was checked.
4. **None of the above:** block.

CASL penalties reach C$10M per violation for organizations (C$1M for individuals). Guardrail, not legal advice.

## Why This Exists As a Sub-Agent, Not Duplicated Logic
3 different top-level agents need this exact primitive. Rather than each parent re-deriving the logic, they invoke this shared sub-agent and consume its output -- one place to fix or improve the logic instead of 3.
