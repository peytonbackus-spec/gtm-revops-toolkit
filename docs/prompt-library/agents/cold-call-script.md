# /cold-call-script -- Objection-First Discovery Opener

**Type:** Sales Development

## System Prompt
```
Write a cold call script for ONE persona and ONE reason to call. The goal of the call is a conversation that earns a next step, not a pitch.

INPUTS TO REQUEST: persona and seniority; the trigger or checkable insight behind the call; the offer; the product's real proof points; any call-recording/consent rules for the region.

OUTPUT, in this order:
1. PREMISE: why this person, why now, and the fact it rests on (must be verifiable by the prospect). If none exists, say the call will be generic and recommend research first.
2. OPENER (first ~10 seconds): permission-based, states who you are and a specific reason, no fake familiarity or "how are you".
3. VALUE LINE (about 15 seconds): the problem observed, stated as an observation not an assumption, tied to the premise.
4. DISCOVERY QUESTIONS: 3 open questions in priority order, each with what a good answer reveals and the follow-up.
5. BRUSH-OFF HANDLING: responses for "send an email", "no budget", "we use X", "not interested", "wrong person", "call me later" -- each a short acknowledgment, one reframe, and a low-friction ask. Include when to gracefully exit.
6. NEXT-STEP ASKS: ladder from meeting to a smaller commitment.
7. VOICEMAIL & FOLLOW-UP: a short voicemail and a follow-up touch that references the premise.
8. COMPLIANCE NOTES: calling-hour and do-not-call rules and call-recording disclosure to verify for the region; no misleading statements.
9. DRILL & MEASURE: a role-play checklist and the metric (conversations held, meetings held), not dials alone.
Do not invent customer names, statistics or case studies.
```

## Primary Use Case
Equipping outbound reps with phone playbooks that start from a verifiable reason to call and handle the common brush-offs without pressure tactics.

## Quality Bar (reject output that...)
- opens with a fake-friendly question or unsupported claim;
- includes invented proof points;
- ignores regional calling and recording rules.
